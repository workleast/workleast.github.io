Welcome to Workleast's homepage!

As an IT engineer, I always desire to make apps that bring real values to the users. I like observing how things work then transforming them into apps.

My family is Buddhist and my dad often took me to the temples. I was interested in watching the masters chanted with their tools. I found them to be bulky and inconvenient to carry around so I kept thinking what if we can have them in our phones and we can use them to chant anytime, anywhere... And that how Gõ Mõ Tụng Kinh (Chanting Suite) app was born.

Gõ Mõ Tụng Kinh (Chanting Suite) app is available to download at:

- [Gõ Mõ Tụng Kinh Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.workleast.GoMoTungKinh)
- [Gõ Mõ Tụng Kinh iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6483859400)
